# pgsql_holidays

PostgreSQL extension to calculate holiday dates for any country.

# Installation

## Build and install PostgreSQL extension

You can build and install the extension using the following commands:

		make
		make installcheck
		sudo make install

NB. Chinese, Hebrew, Hijri, Hindu, and Jalali calendar functions require
another of my libraries:
[calendar_converter_pgsql](https://github.com/christopherthompson81/calendar_converter_pgsql)

# Usage

You can select holidays from the new schema for your country using the
following syntax. Where there are no sub-regions in a country, the parameter is
omitted from the call.

	SELECT * FROM holidays.canada('ON', 2020, 2020);

The query will return the results:

	datestamp       description                authority      day_off      observation_shifted   start_time   end_time

	"2020-12-25"	"Christmas Day"            "federal"       true        false                 "00:00:00"   "24:00:00"

A convienience "by country" function is also provided which accepts many name
variations and defines a default region.

	SELECT * FROM holidays.by_country('canada', 2020, 2020);

The above query would also produce the same output.

# To Do

Cross-port the knowledge from the npm / javascript libraries for the same
purpose. It uses a declarative method (which may be concurrently recorded
here), implements periods, and covers additional countries:

Fill in missing information related to partial holidays, or non-holiday, but special dates:

* https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/

# Feedback

I openly solicit pull requests and issues as feedback to make this package
better. The port from Python was naive and I'm only intimately knowledgable
about my own country's holidays (Canada). I expect many corrections and
enhancements are necessary.
